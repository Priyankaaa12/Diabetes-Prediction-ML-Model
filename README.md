**Diabetes Prediction Model**

 **Project Description**
This project is a machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. The model utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database to train and evaluate its predictions. The application is built using Google Colab, leveraging its cloud-based resources for seamless execution and collaboration.

 **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

 **How to Install and Run the Project**
Since this project is hosted on Google Colab, you do not need to install anything locally. You can run the project directly in your browser. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Open the Google Colab notebook by clicking on the following link: [Diabetes Prediction Model Notebook](insert-your-colab-link-here).
2. If prompted, sign in with your Google account.
3. Make a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive by selecting `File > Save a copy in Drive`.
 
 **How to Use the Project**
1. **Open the Notebook**: Once you have made a copy of the notebook, open it in Google Colab.
2. **Upload the Dataset**: If the dataset is not included in the notebook, you can upload the `Diabetes.csv` file directly to the Colab environment by using the following code snippet:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()

**Run the Cells**: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially. This will preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance. You can run a cell by clicking on it and pressing Shift + Enter.

**View Results**: After running all the cells, you will see the model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and visualizations of the results.

**Make Predictions**: You can modify the input values in the prediction section of the notebook to test the model with different health metrics.
